                        <h3>Past</h3>
                        <p>I was born in Miami, FL, and moved to GA early on. This has made me a mix of Cuban and Southern in an interesting way. I lost my ability to speak Spanish long ago, but can still understand it.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Present</h3>
                        <p>I am currently living at home and working while getting degrees from KSU. I've faced a few trials to reach this position, but ultimately, I am happier now than I was months ago.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Future</h3>
                        <p>I want to go into IT as a sort of back-up. I love science and technology so I field where I could do a bit of both would be great, but being realistic I'll probably get a customer service job.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>School</h3>
                        <p>I currently attend KSU. I attended UGA for all of one semester before needing a break and transferring online. More on that in the Trauma section. I enjoy KSU the coursework is manageable and I haven't encountered many disagreeable people.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Work</h3>
                        <p>I work the overnight shift at an Amazon Sortation Center. This is not my ideal job, but it pays surprisingly well and allows me to afford school while I attend college. If possible, I would like to work in one of Amazon's IT Departments.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Hobby</h3>
                        <p>Gaming! Videogames are my favorite and almost only hobby. They sparked my interest in IT and cybersecurity. I am currently playing World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Minecraft. I used to play competetive games, but had a falling out once Overwatch 2 released.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Passion</h3>
                        <p>As I said before, I have a passion for technology. I like everything from coding &#40;though I find it very tedious at times&#41; to software design. This makes it easy for me to sit at my computer for HOURS on end.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Trauma</h3>
                        <p>I'm not all fun and games. I had struggled with mental health for months hence me leaveing UGA. During that time, I found out I was autistic, which helped explain a lot of the issues I encountered.</p>

                    <div class="cardtext">
                        <h3>Sarcasm</h3>
                        <p>Sarcasm is a big part of who I am. It allows me to be funny even when feeling really down. I mean, a sarcastic autistic person is pretty rare, right?</p>
